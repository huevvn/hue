# Hue - Productivity Tool

**Hue** is a productivity tool aimed at enhancing your productivity through to-do lists, calendar management, habit tracking, and journaling. This project is currently under development, but the landing page and UI have been built with a modern design using [Shadcn](https://github.com/Shadcn/ui) and [Aceternity UI](https://github.com/aceternity/ui).

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, start the development server with one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

After the server starts, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page will auto-update as you make changes.

### Project Tech Stack
Next.js - Framework for building the app.
Shadcn UI and Aceternity UI - Design components for a modern and clean UI.
AWS (potential future deployment) or Vercel - Cloud hosting platforms.
DynamoDB or Prisma (undecided) - Database management options.

### Features (Under Development)
To-Do List Management
Calendar Integration
Habit Tracking
Journaling

### Deployment
Currently, I am exploring deployment options. While AWS is one of the potential platforms, I havenâ€™t decided on the final hosting solution yet. For now, the project can be easily deployed using Vercel, and I will update the README with deployment details as the project progresses.

### Contributing
The project is still in active development. Contributions, suggestions, and issue reports are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
