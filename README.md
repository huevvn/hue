Hue - Productivity Tool
This is a Next.js project for Hue, a productivity tool aimed at enhancing your productivity through to-do lists, calendar management, habit tracking, and journaling. The project is currently under development, but the landing page and UI have been built with a modern design using Shadcn and Aceternity UI.

Getting Started
To run the project locally, start the development server with the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
After the server starts, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Deployment
I am currently exploring deployment options, and while AWS is one of the potential platforms, I havenâ€™t decided on the final hosting solution yet. For now, the project can be deployed easily using Vercel, and I'll update the README with deployment details as the project progresses.
